# üå°Ô∏è DHT11 Monitoring System

A complete sensor-based system to monitor **temperature and humidity** using the **DHT11 sensor** and trigger a **relay** when thresholds are exceeded. This project was built for the **Sensor-Based Systems (STTHK3113)** midterm assessment.

## üß† Background

Environmental monitoring systems are crucial in various settings‚Äîfrom smart homes to industrial automation‚Äîto ensure safe conditions and optimal performance. This project aims to simulate a basic Internet of Things (IoT) setup using the **ESP32 microcontroller** with a **DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor**, a **relay**, and an optional **OLED display**. 

The ESP32 sends sensor data every 10 seconds to a backend server, which then stores it in a SQL database. If predefined thresholds (e.g., temperature > 26¬∞C or humidity > 70%) are exceeded, a relay is triggered to activate an alert mechanism like a fan or buzzer. A mobile application, built with Flutter, retrieves the data and displays it in near real-time graphs‚Äîhelping users visualize and respond to changing environmental conditions.
